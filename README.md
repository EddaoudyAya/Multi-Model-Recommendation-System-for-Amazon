  Multi-Model Recommendation System for Amazon
</h1>


##  Project Overview
This project presents the design, implementation, and deployment of an **intelligent, modular, and scalable recommendation system** for Amazon products. It integrates **four recommendation approaches** and a **sentiment analysis module**, all accessible through an **interactive Streamlit web application**.

The goal is to provide personalized, diverse, and accurate product recommendations while addressing **cold-start**, **data sparsity**, and **user preference variability**.

---

##  Key Features
- **Four Recommendation Models:**
  - **Popularity-Based Filtering** ‚Äì For cold-start users with no history
  - **Content-Based Filtering** ‚Äì TF-IDF on product descriptions using cosine similarity
  - **Collaborative Filtering (Model-Based)** ‚Äì SVD matrix factorization with Surprise
  - **Hybrid Model** ‚Äì Combines all approaches for balanced performance

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - NLP-based classification of customer reviews
  - **Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes** model with **70.43% accuracy**
  - Converts 1‚Äì5 star ratings into sentiment labels (-1, 0, 1)

- **Interactive Web Interface:**
  - Real-time recommendation display
  - Dynamic model selection and visualization
  - User-friendly exploration of product details and review insights

- **Big Data Compatibility:**
  - Processing pipeline built with **PySpark**
  - Integration with **MongoDB** for data storage
  - Modular Python architecture for scalability

##  Models and Methodology

### üîπ Popularity-Based Filtering
Ranks products based on their average rating and number of reviews. Ideal for new users.

### üîπ Content-Based Filtering
Uses **TF-IDF** on product descriptions to compute cosine similarity and recommend similar items.

### üîπ Collaborative Filtering (Model-Based)
Employs **SVD** matrix factorization (via Surprise library). Integrates sentiment probabilities as implicit user feedback.

### üîπ Hybrid Model
Weighted fusion of the above three models ‚Äî ensures robust performance across various user scenarios.

### üîπ Sentiment Analysis
- Label generation: `1-2 ‚Üí -1 (Negative)`, `3 ‚Üí 0 (Neutral)`, `4-5 ‚Üí 1 (Positive)`
- Models tested: SVC, Multinomial NB, Bernoulli NB
- **Final model:** Bernoulli NB with **70.43% accuracy**

## üìà Model Evaluation

###  Recommendation Model Results (sample of 1,000 products)
| Method | Precision | Recall | Diversity |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Content-Based | 47.4% | 47.4% | 0.986 |
| Collaborative | 0.4% | 0.4% | 0.991 |
| Popularity | 0.04% | 0.04% | 0.984 |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Results on small datasets suffer from sparsity. Full-scale tests (>100K items) show improved collaborative filtering (>30% precision).

###  Sentiment Analysis Model Results
| Model | Accuracy | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| SVC (C=0.01) | 66.08% | ‚Äì |
| Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes | 70.09% | ‚Äì |
| **Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes** | **70.43%** | ‚úÖ Selected |

## üñ•Ô∏è Application Interface (Streamlit)

The Streamlit dashboard allows users to:
1. Choose a recommendation model (Content, Collaborative, Hybrid, Popularity)
2. Select or search for a product
3. Generate top-N recommendations with product images, ratings, and prices
4. Explore visual results dynamically
